# Analyze Purchase Records to Determine Sales-Tax Engine Solution
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze purchase records to locate transactions within states that collect sales tax.

The full analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebook called `transactional-data-analysis.ipynb` within the `notebook` folder.

I found a dataset called `iowa_liquor_sales` in Google's BigQuery Public Data Set which contains ~22.2 million records of transactional liqor sales data in the state of Iowa by county. I extracted 7 million rows of data for the purposes of this analysis.

This dataset will serve as a proxy, wherein I will analyze liquor sale transactions across counties in Iowa instead of technology sales transactions in states accross the United States. My goal with this analysis is to demonstrate analytics, SQL, data cleaning and visualization skills.
